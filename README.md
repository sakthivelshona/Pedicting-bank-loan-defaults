## Introduction

In this project, we explore historical loan data, preprocess it, and train machine learning models to predict whether a loan is likely to default. The predictive models are built using a combination of feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
- Model evaluation and comparison using appropriate metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
