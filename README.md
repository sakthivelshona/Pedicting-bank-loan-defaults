## Introduction

In this project, we explore historical loan data, preprocess it, and train machine learning models to predict whether a loan is likely to default. The predictive models are built using a combination of feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
- Model evaluation and comparison using appropriate metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predicting-loan-defaults.git

1. Install the reuired libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Follow these steps to utilize the project:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dataset in the `data` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, visualization, and model training.
4. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters.
5. Evaluate model performance and choose the best model for predictions.
